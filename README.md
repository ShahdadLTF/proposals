## Rupaya Governance and Proposals

Rupaya aims to have a proposals platform and process that is:

* Open and inclusive
* Simple and user-friendly
* Financially and professionally rewarding

## How it works

1. Login to your GitHub account
2. Create a proposal draft as a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/rupaya-project/proposals/issues). For example:

    https://github.com/rupaya-project/proposals/issues/1
    
3. Based on community comments and feedback, refine the proposal
4. Once ready, the proposal will be merged into the repository
5. You will receive a READ-ONLY short link from an Admin
6. Use the link to submit the proposal on the blockchain (guide will be provided)
7. Wait for the MasterNodes owners to vote on your proposal, one vote per masternode instance


## Technical details

Once the chain reaches block **86,400**, the first _superblock_, governance proposals can be submitted.
