## Rupaya Governance and Proposals

The Rupaya Community Governance will allow anyone with a Rupaya wallet to submit project proposals for integrations, promoting, new exchanges, marketing, dev, etc and get the requested RUPX coins if MasterNode owners support it with **Yes** votes.

Rupaya aims to have a proposals platform and process that is:

* Open and inclusive
* Simple and user-friendly
* Financially and professionally rewarding

## How it works

1. Login to your GitHub account
2. Create a proposal draft as a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/rupaya-project/proposals/issues). For example:

    https://github.com/rupaya-project/proposals/issues/1
    
3. Based on community comments and feedback, refine the proposal
4. Once ready, it will be merged into the 'final' directory of the proposals repository
5. You will receive a READ-ONLY short link from an Admin
6. Use the link to submit the proposal on the blockchain. Step by step instructions [here](guides/mn_governance_proposals.md)
7. Wait for the MasterNodes owners to vote on your proposal, one vote per masternode instance
