## Rupaya Governance and Proposals

The SUB1X community governance program will allow anyone with the updated version of the wallet to submit project proposals for integration, promotion, new exchange listings, marketing, development, etc and get the requested SUB1X coins if MasterNode owners support it with **Yes** votes.

SUB1X aims to have a proposals platform that is:

* Open and inclusive
* Simple and user-friendly
* Financially and professionally rewarding

## How it works

View active SUB1X proposals that MasterNode owners can vote on: http://sub1x-testnet.mn.zone/proposals.html
Alternatively, you can use the 'PROPOSALS' menu link. 

Click on the proposal title to read more details about it. When ready to vote, click the `VOTE NOW` button of the proposal and copy the command you need to run.

## How do proposals end up on the page

Before a proposal is submitted, we recommend opening it up for public discussion. This ensures that your proposal is reasonable enough to pass the voting standards. You can read more about the creation process below.

## How to create a proposal
1. Login to your GitHub account
2. Create a proposal draft as a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/rupaya-project/proposals/issues). For example:

    https://github.com/rupaya-project/proposals/issues/1
    
3. Based on community comments and feedback, refine the proposal
4. Once ready, it will be merged into the 'final' directory of the proposals repository
5. You will receive a READ-ONLY short link from an Admin
6. Use the link to submit the proposal on the blockchain. Step by step instructions on how to do this are [here]()
7. Wait for the MasterNodes owners to vote on your proposal. Only 1 vote is allowed per MN instance.
