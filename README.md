## Rupaya Governance and Proposals

Rupaya aims to have a proposals platform and process that is:

* Open and inclusive
* Simple and user-friendly
* Financially and professionally rewarding

## How it works

1. Login to you GitHub account 
2. Create a proposal draft as a GitHub Issue using a built-in template. For example:

    https://github.com/rupaya-project/proposals/issues/1
    
3. Based on community comments and feedback, refine the proposal
4. Once ready, the proposal will be merged into the repository
5. You will receive a READ-ONLY link from an Admin that can be used to submit the proposal
6. Use the link to create a proposal on the blockchain(guide will be provided)
7. Wait for MasterNodes voting outcome


## Technical details

Once the chain reaches block **43200**, the first _superblock_, governance proposals can be submitted.
MasterNode owners can then review and vote on them, one vote per masternode server.
