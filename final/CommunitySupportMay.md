## Requested Funds

* One time proposal of **50** SUB1X (11.5% from the monthly governance budget)
* **0.05** SUB1X to cover the proposal submission and transfer fees to winners

Paid to my address `ZZgxu9G4pehp7DP7mE8khkXNGTucKow53i` and then distributed as described below.

## Describe your proposal

The coins will be distributed to five users that are the most active and helpful in the community.
For example moderators, tech support in Discord, Bitcointalk, Proposals repo, etc

If this proposal passes, we can have a Discord announcement with the nominees. Each will have an emoji number attached. Top five will be picked based on the number of emoji votes. 

The winners will receive a 10 SUB1X reward for their dedication to the project and community.
They could also receive a special Discord role(Community Superstar, or similar) for the next month.
The aim is to reward good behavior with a good amount of SUB1X coins!

If this is a success, we can have it as a monthly proposal, starting from the next budget cycle.
