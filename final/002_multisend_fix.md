## Requested funds

**10,000 RUPX** from may 2018 Governance fund (one time) for devs + **50 RUPX** as fee for submitting the proposal.

**Total = 10,050 RUPX** to be paid to the address `75xDs6VPvSXLpMZJUWR4EoisykG1mppyNk` if MasterNode owners support it with `yes` votes.

## Description of the proposal

Working on the multisend feature of the Rupaya Qt Wallet. At the moment it's not working so it need to be fixed.
This feature could be helpful for those who want to send money automatically to a charity fund, exchange, or to a member of a shared masternode, etc.

**Once the bug is fixed and tested by the community**, I will release the funds to the dev(s) that helped fix it.
