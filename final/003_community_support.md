## Requested Funds

* One time proposal of **30,000** RUPX
* **50** RUPX to cover the proposal submission fee 

Paid to one of my addresses `76tKZXUVoZx4ZuHGjthugt9pFiBHRSfFfo`

## Describe your proposal

The coins will be distributed to five users that are the most active and helpful in the community.
For example: moderators, tech support in Discord, Bitcointalk, Proposals repo, etc

If this proposal passes, we can have a Discord announcement with the nominees. Each will have an emoji number attached. Top five will be picked based on the number of emoji votes. 

The winners will receive a 6,000 RUPX reward for their dedication to the project and community.
They could also receive a special Discord role(Community Superstar, or similar) for the next month.
The aim is to reward good behavior with a good amount of RUPX!

If this is a success, we can have it as a monthly proposal, starting from the next budget cycle.
